Documentation for proposal distribution

The proposal distribution is a very significant part of the MCMC algorithm and it's choice can make or break the optimisation routine.

The basic proposal distribution is a gaussian function with uniform step size in all directions. This is not always appropriate because the residual landscape may not always be equally scaled. For example in the Rosenbrock banana, a valley exists where the change in residual is large in one direction but small in another. In such a case, the basic proposal distribution fails because there is no biased between the large and small change direction. The result is the optimiser gets stuck because the large change direction forces the universal step size to be small, countering the progress attempted when the optimser encounters the small change direction.

One can imagine that the narrower the valley is, the more significant this problem becomes because the optimers effectively doesn't see the gap.

A way around this is to incorporate a vector on top of the search step. This biases the search direction of the optimers, allowing it to favour a direction if it has stepped down that direction a few times.

The proposed algorithm is as such:
	- Start off with no bias (2-norm of vector is 1 and equal in all dimensions)
	- Get new point, test for acceptance, change step size if necessary
	- If accepted, normalised the direction of the new point from the old point such that the direction is always pointing in the positive direction in each dimension, and the size of this vector is the same as the current step size. Add it to the current direction vector and renormalise to one.
